⚠️ Do not delete this directory!  You can delete the blog post files in this directory, but you should still keep this directory around as Jekyll expects this folder to exist.

# Auto-convert markdown files To Posts

[`fastpages`](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) will automatically convert markdown files saved into this directory as blog posts!

You must save your notebook with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`.  Examples of valid filenames are:

```shell
2020-01-28-My-First-Post.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```

## Azeem's Markdown edit for testing
so I'm writing here as a test to see if this will show up in my Github Repo after pushing this change.
