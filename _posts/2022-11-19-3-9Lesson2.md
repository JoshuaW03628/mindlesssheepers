# Lesson Overview
- Focused on creating or developing algorithms using a flowchart or natural language
- An algorithm can contain selection or iteration
    - Either way, they need to be sequenced properly in order to have the intended result

# How to set up a Flowchart
- A Flowchart can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm
- Step 1: label the start point
- Step 2: consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask
- Step 3: write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is true
- Step 4: repeat step 3, but this time, if the answer is false
- Step 5: write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly
- Step 6: determine a way to reach the end goal

# Selection vs. Iteration

# Example A
- Consider this situation:
    - You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket
    - You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off
    - There is another sale on produce for 20% off
    - Tax on all items is 8%
    - Your TASK: calculate the cost of your favorite item using an algorithm! (start out with a flowchart)
